# Fix My City!

Fix My City! is a submission to the 2014 GovHack project.

Our idea was to create a very simple mobile friendly webapp that allows members of the public to take photos of things that need attention in our city and upload them without having to provide all the details manually. These are populated automatically using Brisbane City Council data from http://data.gov.au
